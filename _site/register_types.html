<h1 class="post-title">Types of register</h1>

<h2 id="1-simple-list-single-custodian">1: Simple list, single custodian</h2>
<p><img src="images/register-type-1.png" alt="Diagram showing the creation process from custodian to register to services" /></p>

<p>This is the simplest type of register. A single person maintains a list of things and publishes it to a register for services to use. The <a href="http://country.beta.openregister.org/">country register</a> is an example of this.</p>

<h2 id="2-service-maintaining-register">2: Service maintaining register</h2>
<p><img src="images/register-type-2.png" alt="Diagram showing the creation process from service to register and back to  services, with a custodian performing a QA role" /></p>

<p>This form of register is created using a service, and the custodian performs a quality assurance role. For example, a register of companies would be created from the <em>register a company</em> service, but how that service is managed is the job of the custodian.</p>

<h2 id="3-multiple-custodians-aggregated-register">3: Multiple custodians, aggregated register</h2>
<p><img src="images/register-type-3.png" alt="Register Type 1" /></p>

<p>In this case <em>subsections</em> of the register are maintained by different custodians and each subsection is aggregated in to a single register. This is how AddressBase is currently created, with GeoPlace performing the aggregation.</p>

<h2 id="4-multiple-custodian--registers-aggregated">4: Multiple custodian &amp; registers, aggregated</h2>
<p><img src="images/register-type-4.png" alt="Register Type 1" /></p>

<p>This is where more than one register is created as per type 1 above, but each register is the same ‘shape’ and is later aggregated by a service. Example of this might include identical registers for England Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that are merged in to a UK wide register.</p>
